LightPainting
=============

LightPainting coded with Processing 2.0.2

This sketch is for educational use. 
I want to compare different options to produce light-painting 
(Digital camera with long expose time VS Digital webcam and programming)

As you can see in the code, programmation is not my job. ;)
So... every help will be very appreciated. 

Some examples :

- Light display optimization :
  The actual basic code display all pixels above a brithness limit 
  but there are some big "splash" which appears sometimes. 
  These "splash" are ugly when we just want to draw a line or write a word

- Default resolution mode for webcam (640x480)

- Display different resolutions in the same 640x480 frame

- Save the final png file in the forlder where the user want to save it


Thanks a lot for any help.
