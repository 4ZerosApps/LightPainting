LightPainting
=============

LightPainting coded with Processing 2.0.2

This sketch is for educationnal use. 
I want to compare different ways to produce LightPainting 
(Digital camera with long expose time VS Digital webcam and programming)

As you can see if you check the code, programmation is not my job. ;)
So... every help will be very appreciated. In particular for :

- light display :
  The actual basic code display all pixel above a brithness limit 
  but there are some big "splash" which appears sometimes. 
  These "splash" are ugly and cause graphics problems when we just want to draw a line or write a word

- Find a default resolution mode for webcam (640x480)

- Display different resolutions in 640x480 frame

- Save the final png file in the forlder where the user want to save it


Thanks a lot for any help.
